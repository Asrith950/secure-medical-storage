## 🤖 Enable ChatGPT for the Chatbot (Optional)

By default, the chatbot uses built‑in general health replies. To link it with ChatGPT (or any OpenAI‑compatible LLM URL):

1) Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` folder (same level as `index.js`) with:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# If you're using a custom ChatGPT/OpenAI‑compatible endpoint (e.g., Azure OpenAI or a proxy), set the base URL:
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
# Optionally choose a model
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

2) Restart the backend (stop and start the website again). When configured, the chatbot will call the LLM; if not, it will fall back to the built‑in responses.

Notes:
- Your API key stays on the server; the frontend never sends it.
- If `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is omitted, it defaults to the standard OpenAI API.
- If no API key is set, the chatbot still works with built‑in guidance.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- If website doesn't load, make sure both MongoDB and website are running
- Keep all terminal windows open while using the website
- Your data persists between sessions - it's saved in MongoDB
- For any issues, try stopping everything and restarting

## 💾 Data Storage

Your medical records, reminders, and profile data are securely stored in MongoDB and will persist between sessions.
